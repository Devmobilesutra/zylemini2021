              {'\n'}When you use our Platform, we collect and store your
              information which is provided by you from time to time. In
              general, you can browse the Platform without telling us who you
              are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you
              give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.
              Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which
              fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide
              information by choosing not to use a particular service, product
              or feature on the Platform. We may track your buying behaviour,
              preferences, and other information that you choose to provide on
              our Platform. We use this information to do internal research on
              our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better
              understand, protect and serve our users. This information is
              compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
              include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
              our Platform or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL
              is on our Platform or not), your computer browser information, and
              your IP address. We collect personal information (such as email
              address, delivery address, name, phone number, credit card/debit
              card and other payment instrument details) from you when you set
              up an account or transact with us. While you can browse some
              sections of our Platform without being a registered member,
              certain activities (such as placing an order or consuming our
              online content or services) do require registration. We do use
              your contact information to send you offers based on your previous
              orders and your interests. If you choose to post messages on our
              message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave
              feedback or if you use voice commands to shop on the Platform, we
              will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this
              information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer
              support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. If you send
              us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other
              users or third parties send us correspondence about your
              activities or postings on the Platform, we may collect such
              information into a file specific to you. If you enrol into our
              SuperCoins Loyalty Program, we will collect and store your
              personal information such as name, contact number, email address,
              communication address, date of birth, gender, zip code, lifestyle
              information, demographic and work details which is provided by you
              to SAPL or a third-party business partner that operates
              online/offline establishments or platforms where you can earn
              SuperCoins for purchase of goods and services, and redeem
              SuperCoins. We will also collect your information related to your
              transactions on SAPL platform and such third-party business
              partner platforms. When such third-party business partner collects
              your personal information directly from you, you will be governed
              by their privacy policies. SAPL shall not be responsible for the
              third-party business partner’s privacy practices or the content of
              their privacy policies, and we request you to read their privacy
              policies prior to disclosing any information. SAPL has onboarded
              certain third-party business partners on the Platform who
              specialise in the categories like travel ticket reservations,
              booking online movie tickets, paying online bills and more
              (Ultra-Partners). If you use the services of Ultra-Partners, you
              will be redirected to Ultra-Partners websites/applications and
              your entry to Ultra-Partners websites/applications will be based
              on your SAPL login credentials after seeking your permissions to
              share the data further. SAPL shall not be responsible for the
              Ultra-Partner’s privacy practices or the content of their privacy
              policies, and we request you to read their privacy policies prior
              to disclosing any information. {'\n'}

              device information. We may also request you to provide your PAN,
              GST Number, Government issued ID cards/number and
              Know-Your-Customer (KYC) details to: (i) check your eligibility
              for certain products and services including but not limited to

              products and services purchased for your business requirements;
              (iii) enhance your experience on the Platform and provide you
              access to the products and services being offered by us, sellers,
              affiliates or lending partners. You understand that your access to
              these products/services may be affected in the event consent is
              not provided to us. In our efforts to continually improve our
              product and service offerings, we and our affiliates collect and
              analyse demographic and profile data about our users' activity on
              our Platform. We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose
              problems with our server, and to administer our Platform. Your IP
              address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad
              demographic information. We will occasionally ask you to
              participate in optional surveys conducted either by us or through
              a third party market research agency. These surveys may ask you
              for personal information, contact information, date of birth,
              demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level),
              attributes such as your interests, household or lifestyle
              information, your purchasing behaviour or history, preferences,
              and other such information that you may choose to provide. The
              surveys may involve collection of voice data or video recordings,
              the participation of which would purely be voluntary in nature. We
              use this data to tailor your experience at our Platform, providing
              you with content that we think you might be interested in and to
              display content according to your preferences.{'\n'}
